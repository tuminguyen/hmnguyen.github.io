## Welcome to my personal site
---

This repo contains code for my e-portfolio website. You can access it [here](https://tuminguyen.github.io/hmnguyen.github.io/).

Though it is a static webpage, I will more frequently do the updates for UI and post more blogs/demos on it. 

Something you may not know about my webpage:
- The colors of key terms are generated randomly in about me page so you will see they have different color values whenever you reload or refresh the page. It is inspired by my laziness to pick up every colors for them and it will look so boring if they are all black. 

- Each blog is already prepared, written and saved in markdown file. I just load it via the corresponding id of the blog and put it in the same template for the blog detail. 

All the work (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are coded and pushed by me.
